# AmesPAHdbIDLSuite

A suite of IDL object classes to work with a downloaded NASA Ames PAH
IR Spectroscopic Database XML-file.

## Getting Started

The NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database (PAHdb) website is located
at
[www.astrochemistry.org/pahdb/](https://www.astrochemistry.org/pahdb/). The
current stable version of the _AmesPAHdbIDLSuite_ is dated April 15,
2020 and can be obtained from
[GitHub](https://github.com/PAHdb/AmesPAHdbIDLSuite/).

A comprehensive guide on using the _AmesPAHdbIDLSuite_ can be found
via PAHdb's [Documentation
Portal](https://pahdb.github.io/AmesPAHdbIDLSuite/).

### Prerequisites

The _AmesPAHdbIDLSuite_ requires
[IDL](http://www.harrisgeospatial.com/ProductsandTechnology/Software/IDL.aspx). IDL
is a registered trademark of [Harris
Geospatial](http://www.harrisgeospatial.com/). The open source
IDL-replacement [GDL](https://github.com/gnudatalanguage/gdl) is
currently incompatible with the suite.

The _AmesPAHdbIDLSuite_ is intended to work with a downloaded NASA
Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database XML-file, which can be obtained
from the [downloads](https://www.astrochemistry.org/pahdb/downloads)
section at the PAHdb-website.

### Installing

Step-by-step instructions on installing the _AmesPAHdbIDLSuite_ can be
