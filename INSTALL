These are the instruction on how to install the AmesPAHdbIDLSuite
accompanying the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database. The suite
has been tested with IDL versions 7.0 through 8.4. The IDL-versions of
NNLS requires IDL version 8.0 or higher due to its use of the
!NULL. The open source IDL-replacement GDL is currently not compatible
with the suite due to its lack of an XML-parsing interface.

1)   Unpack the suite, e.g., tar xvaf AmesPAHdbIDLSuite.

2)   Put the files in a directory accessible by IDL or update the IDL
     !PATH variable, e.g., !PATH = !PATH + ":/path/to/AmesPAHdbIDLSuite/"

3)   Obtain the XML version(s) of the database from the website
     http://www.astrochem.org/pahdb/

4)   Place the XML file(s) somewhere and, optionally, set either or both
     of the system and IDL AMESPAHDEFAULTDB environment variables for
     the default database file you want to use, e.g.
     defsysv,'!AMESPAHDEFAULTDB',"/path/to/theoretical.xml" and export
     AMESPAHDEFAULTDB='/path/to/theoretical.xml' (case-sensitive!)

5)   Run example programs from the 'examples' directory to verify
     proper installation of the suite
