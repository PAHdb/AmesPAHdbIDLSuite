These are the instruction on how to install the AmesPAHdbIDLSuite
accompanying the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database. The suite
has been tested with IDL versions 7.0 through 8.6.1.
The AmesPAHdbIDLSuite's version of NNLS requires IDL version 8.0 or
higher due to its use of !NULL. Note that it is possible to use of an
externally defined NNLS-implementation. See the docs for details. The
open source IDL-replacement GDL might be compatible with the suite,
although this has not been tested.

1)   Unpack the suite, e.g., tar xvaf AmesPAHdbIDLSuite.

2)   Put the files in a directory accessible by IDL or update the IDL
     !PATH variable, e.g., !PATH = !PATH + ":/path/to/AmesPAHdbIDLSuite/"

3)   Obtain the XML version(s) of the database from the website
     https://www.astrochemistry.org/pahdb/

4)   Place the XML file(s) somewhere and, optionally, set either or both
     of the system and IDL AMESPAHDEFAULTDB environment variables for
     the default database file you want to use, e.g.
     defsysv,'!AMESPAHDEFAULTDB',"/path/to/theoretical.xml" or export
     AMESPAHDEFAULTDB='/path/to/theoretical.xml' (case-sensitive!)

5)   Run example programs from the 'examples'-directory to verify
     proper installation of the suite
